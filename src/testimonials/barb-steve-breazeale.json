        "Earlier this year, Bolte Construction remodeled our small outdated bathroom. We called and he was a real person at the other end of the line - no leaving a message. That was worthy of a gold star. After discussing what we were interested in doing, an appointment was set up so he could provide an estimate. Here his second gold star - he was on time. Not only was he prompt, but courteous, knowledgeable and encouraging. Needless to say, he was hired for the job.",
        "The work begain exactly on schedule. He was in contact with us for each detail and gave excellent advice when needed. All of his workers were also considerate and efficient. At the end of each workday, there was never a mess for us to clean up. We couldn't be more pleased with the final result.",
        "When we are ready to undertake the next remodeling adventure, you can be sure Bolte will be the first call we make."
