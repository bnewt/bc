        "Dear Bill,",
        "We would like to thank you for the beautiful remodeling of our main bathroom. We have waited several years to update and it was so worth the wait to find the right company to handle our project.",
        "We appreciated your walking us through the process. You told us the first time we met that we would see progress every day and we did. You promised to keep construction dust as contained as possible and you did. You gave us a timeline and you were spot on. You repeatedly told us you would do whatever we wanted to make sure the project was to our satisfaction and you did just that.",
        "There were truly no hiccups in this entire process and results were even better than we had hoped for. Thank you for your professionalism and please extend our gratitude to your craftsmen. We will confidently recommend you to friends and family because we know first-hand the quality of the workmanship of Bolte Construction."
